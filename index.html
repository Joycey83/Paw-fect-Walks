             <p>
                You may need extra support on days when you have long meetings or work longer hours.  Or you may also just need extra support whilst your dog is a puppy.  
                Puppies will need much more frequent visits for toilet breaks which a dog walker can provide.

              <p> 
                Maybe you could just make things easier by not running home every lunch time or any lunchtime at all.  
                Maybe, depending on the breed that you have, it would free you up in the mornings to spend a bit more quality time with your kids before and after school.
                Some people would say the responsibility for walking your dog comes with owning a dog and that you should, therefore, do it all yourself.
