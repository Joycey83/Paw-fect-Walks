<h1 align="center">Paw-fect Walks</h1>

Paw-fect Walks is a fictious website written in HTML and CSS. It was designed for a dog walking service for the wider community of Croydon. This website also provides walking services in neighbouring areas including Banstead, Sanderstead and Kenley.

My approach for designing this website was to create it being mobile responsive first and for the webpage being accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for all users.

# Target Audience


There was a time that I think people thought of dog walkers as a luxury service.  A luxury for people who can’t be bothered walking their dog or too lazy to dedicate the time actually needed to be a dog owner.  I think those times have changed and people are more aware of both the needs of a dog and the wide variety of reasons to hire a dog walker.
We all know that in reality, life is never simple.   For me, a dog walker was something that I had to have in place before even considering Woody & Ava coming into my life as my work pattern could vary on certain days and at short notice. It’s that complexity of life that in my own experience means people seek out a dog walker for 5 common reasons. Of course there could be many more.

The website hopes to attract 5 main types of customers

1. Customers working long hours at the office
2. High energy breed dog was choosen as a pet
3. Health issues restricting mobility of the owner
4. Recognising dog walking will improve the dogs welbeing
5. behavioural support of your dog


Other  type of users could be customers who have families with young children but owns dogs but due to time contraints with work and raising a family etc. so they need a helping hand from dog walking services like Paw-fect Walks. The other type of users could be very experienced dog owners who live in the local vicinity but due to having a busy work schedule or just being busy for that particular time period those users will consider using community dog walking services like Paw-fect Walks.
