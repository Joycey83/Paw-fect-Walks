<h1 align="center">Paw-fect Walks</h1>

Paw-fect Walks is a fictious website written in HTML and CSS. It was designed for a dog walking service for the wider community of Croydon. This website also provides walking services in neighbouring areas including Banstead, Sanderstead and Kenley. 

[View the live project here.](https://joycey83.github.io/Paw-fect-Walks/)

My approach for designing this website was to create it being mobile responsive first and for the webpage being accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for all users.

# Target Audience


There was a time that I think people thought of dog walkers as a luxury service.  A luxury for people who can’t be bothered walking their dog or too lazy to dedicate the time actually needed to be a dog owner.  I think those times have changed and people are more aware of both the needs of a dog and the wide variety of reasons to hire a dog walker.
We all know that in reality, life is never simple.   For me, a dog walker was something that I had to have in place before even considering Woody & Ava coming into my life as my work pattern could vary on certain days and at short notice. It’s that complexity of life that in my own experience means people seek out a dog walker for 5 common reasons. Of course there could be many more.

The website hopes to attract 5 main types of customers

1. Customers working long hours at the office
2. High energy breed dog was choosen as a pet
3. Health issues restricting mobility of the owner
4. Recognising dog walking will improve the dogs welbeing
5. behavioural support of your dog


Other  type of users could be customers who have families with young children but owns dogs but due to time contraints with work and raising a family etc. so they need a helping hand from dog walking services like Paw-fect Walks. The other type of users could be very experienced dog owners who live in the local vicinity but due to having a busy work schedule or just being busy for that particular time period those users will consider using community dog walking services like Paw-fect Walks.

    # Design
    
    
    + ## Colour Scheme
    The colours that are choosen are predominantly made up of different variations of White, black and brown. This colour scheme was purposely chosen because this is the tri color of all breeds of dogs. I want this type of colour scheme flowing through out my site.

    There are an exceptions to just using variations of tri-color  I have used two different types of red one for my sub heading on the Reason section on the landing page so that the the user can read it more clearly and Tomatoe red for my contact form. As there is a dark background image being used for my contact info Golden Rod was used for easy readability. In total I have used 14 colours but they are just made up of three main colours of White, black and Brown. 

    ### Color Reference

+ ## Typography
The Roboto and Babas Nueue font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto was choosen as the font had a clean,sleek look and has a high readability on the website no matter which colour was used.

+ ## Imagery
Throughout the website there are various background and hero imagery of different dog breeds and parks. They are designed to envoke an emotional response with the user so when they see images of dogs and parks subconciously this will make them think about their own dogs welbeing from a mentally and physically point of view.

  ![Navbar Links](assets/images/navbar-links.JPG)
  
  * One of the main design element for being mobile responsive is that the navigation bar will turn into a hamburger menu when the site is viewed on tablet and mobile devices. when viewed on smaller screen the navigation bar will switch to a sliding menu which will enforce easier readability and better user experience.
![Hamburger Menu](assets/images/mobile-menu.JPG)

* **Features left to implement**

  There are quite a few features that I like to implement in the future for this website:
  * A Paw-fect Walk blog page or section, so I can give regular updates about my own dogs so that there are more interaction with the wider community of Croydon.
  * When the company expands in the future new services such as Dog sitting, Dog boarding will be added to the website for new and existing users.
  * Gallery page to increase more traffic to my website as the human brain processes images a lot faster than processing text or content. by showcasing a vast of images this will encourage protential customers to connect with you and your company too, this will help them to decide if they want to be using your services.
  * Log in system for existing customers so that if they have a profile on our website they could check payment history and they could see daily updates about their dogs, especially when the company expands to other services like dog sitting and dog boarding.
  * Online booking system will be implemented in the future for existing and protential users so that it will be easier to book walks because as of now users will need to fill in the contact form, call or phone us to make a booking.

# Testing
The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project. During the validation process I only incured 1 red error on W3C CSS and 7 yellow warnings on W3C Markup. They have all been recified and fixed during the validation process.
* **Error**
  * I fixed this error by changing the padding from auto to 0%.
  [View Error](assets/images/CSS-warning.PNG)
* **Warnings**
  * I fixed all these warnings on W3C Markup Validator by changing all H1 headings to H2 headings and for the Hero Image section I added a H2 Hidden element as I created a hero image inside a section element without a level heading.
  [View Warnings](assets/images/heading-warning.PNG)

  After recitying all the errors and warnings all my pages on HTML and CSS are now free from any errors and warnings.

+ ## CSS 
   * No more errors or warnings were found when passing all the CSS codes through the Jigsaw W3C CSS Validator.

* ## Compatibility
  * The site has been checked for compatibility on Chrome, Edge and Firefox. The site was not tested on Safari browser as I do not own any Apple devices or do I know any one who does.
* ## Bugs
  * On my Contact page there is a very minute thin gap between the bottom of the navigation bar and the top of background image. I have tried changing the image, adjusted the CSS code numerous times and asked for help from my fellow slackers but the gap is still persistently showing. This tiny gap only shows when the website is opened on the desktop. The tiny gap does not show on mobile and some tablet devices depending on the size.
